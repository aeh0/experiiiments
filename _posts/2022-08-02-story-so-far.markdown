Hello world!

This is where you can find my thoughts, mistakes, frustrations, and (hopefully) solutions, as I work on my AHRC-RLUK Professional Practice Fellowship. Over the next ten months, I've been released from my day job, Archivist at Cardiff University Special Collections and Archives, to focus solely on a practice-based research question. How can the library develop and deliver a new infrastructure and service to support the sustainable  creation and use  of digital archives, and encourage its adoption through accessible training materials?

But before we get to that - how did I end up here?

The early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, physically separated from both collections and researchers, provided both the opportunity and necessity to explore options for hosting our digital assets online, reuniting collections and researchers in a virtual space. The library lacked a digital asset management system, although many of our collections had been photographed over the years for digitisation projects led by partner institutions, such as the National Library of Wales. As  Archivist, I had liaised with our partners to create Dublin Core metadata according to their specifications, and managed imaging workflows with our photographer.

In the first few weeks of lockdown, myself and my colleagues scrambled to develop a resource guide for online primary sources, to help our final year humanities students who were in the thick of research for their dissertations, abruptly cut off from access to physical collections by world events. In the course of this, I discovered that one major collaborative digital project we had submitted content to was no longer live or accessible. This led me to begin an audit of all our digital content, and search for new, temporary accommodation.

The Internet Archive came to the rescue. Perhaps more well known for archiving websites, the Internet Archive can also host copies of books and archives, provided that an institution is willing to license their content for public access. Just make sure your files are named systematically and incrementally, upload them with some basic metadata, and the Internet Archive will do the rest, for free.
