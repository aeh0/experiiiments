Let’s get one thing clear – I don’t have anything against Wordpress. It does a lot of things well. But in recent years I’ve seen it become a platform, not just for blogs or personal websites, but for externally funded, academic research outputs. Proprietary blogging and social media platforms are restricted in functionality: their design and accompanying research dictated by the limitations of those platforms. They're precarious: vulnerable to obsolescence and technical failure, institutionally unsupported and unsustainable, creating future compatibility and data migration challenges. These concerns drove and underpinned my application to the RLUK-AHRC Professional Practice Fellowship scheme. 

I was keen to set up a blog to document and communicate the progress of my Fellowship. Rather than for head straight for Wordpress, what better opportunity to explore the alternatives?

I'd heard a lot about static-site generators, and something called jekyll, that apparently worked well with GitHub to create simple, freely-hosted websites. I didn't require much from a blog - just a place to record thoughts and the odd image, in a tidy, systematic way.

A search for jekyll and GitHub pages turned up GitHub Skills, which featured a tutorial on setting up a simple blog, hosted on GitHub.
