What are the main activities that you have undertaken as part of your fellowship to date? These might include literature reviews, research trips, or interviews.

NEW LIBRARY SERVICE AND TRAINING TO SUPPORT RESEARCHERS IN PUBLISHING DIGITAL OUTPUTS VIA ALMA DIGITAL

- Testing to define and diagnose IIIF functionality issues with Alma Digital following an update by the supplier (Ex Libris). 

- Developing short-term workarounds to allow the delivery of time-sensitive projects affected by this failure of functionality.

- Extensive liaison and network building with relevant technical communities to obtain guidance and support with these issues. I have reached out to Ex Libris developers, as well as Alma Digital, IIIF, and Universal Viewer user communities via Twitter and Slack.

- Writing and delivering a paper at the WHELF 2022 conference (Welsh Higher Education Libraries Forum), attended by library staff from Welsh HEIs. Ex Libris supplies Alma, a Library Management System, to all HEIs in Wales as part of a consortium contract, but Cardiff University is the first among them to adopt Alma Digital as an image repository. Due to its ease of integration with the Alma LMS, conference attendees were keen to hear about our experiences with Alma Digital. The paper aimed to raise awareness of the IIIF functionality offered by Alma Digital, and the ways in which it allows content to be interoperably distributed to a wide range of teaching and research outputs. 

- Writing and delivering a subsequent paper at an international conference - IGeLU (International Group of Ex Libris Users). Since writing the paper for WHELF, the IIIF functionality it promoted had been lost following an update by Ex Libris.  These successfully raised awareness of the added value of IIIF to Alma Digital, and the signification of its current failure in functionality for users. This has expedited a response from the Alma Digital project owner and his development team - the issue has now been allocated the highest priority level, though at the time of writing, remains unresolved.
- Developed ingest workflows to support the load of content for Crowd Cymru and a student internship (School of Architecture), establishing limits of Alma Digital
- IIIF network (quantify UK uptake in attendance/engagement - numbers and percentage/proportion)

TRAINING IN DIGITAL EXHIBITION TOOLS AND DH TOOLS

- Set up a static website to use as a blog. As well as using this to document progress, it formed part of my research - a proof of concept model for delivering free, secure hosting without adverts or branding. Expand on this
- Trip to University of Wyoming (funded from another project grant) to discuss DH training, online exhibitions, digitisation workflows, digital platforms. Expand?
- Developed a proof of concept Xerte-based website to support a student internship (School of Welsh), testing its limitations. Expand
- Requirements gathering, design and delivery of two 2022/23 sessions on Digitisation and Digital Archives for all postgraduate students in the School of History, Archaeology and Religion, which has been authorised as a mandatory research methods session for future years. Expand
- Ongoing self-training via Free Code Camp

What work do you intend to undertake in the near future during your fellowship?

- Other School of Welsh project
- Reviewing exhibition platforms - pros/cons/limits/functionality/integration
- Researching and writing training materials suitable for an introduction to DH for deliver to undergraduate and postgraduates in School of English, Communication and Philosophy in 2023/24

Please describe how you have worked with your mentor and any future meetings planned.

- In August, I visited University of Wyoming with my mentor and had many useful meetings with our equivalents to exchange practices and ideas. We meet monthly to discuss fellowship progress.

Has anything surprised you? Have you had any unexpected findings?

- My first goal was to explore the capacity and limitations of Alma Digital - What can it do? What can't it do? What tools can it integrate with? What can be changed? What needs more work/devt/investment? While testing, I discovered a critical issue with IIIF integration, which had arisen following a software update just prior to the start of the fellowship. 

Have you had to adapt your research due to any unexpected circumstances/findings?

- The issue prevented the construction of any of the tools and platforms that I'd planned, and so the first couple of months were dedicated to testing, trialling, documenting, liaising, and lobbying for the issue to be rectified by the software company.

What plans do you have to share your findings within your institution/within the sector?

- Ongoing blogging and twitter engagement
- Respond to 2023 call for papers (DCDC, WHELF, IIIF)
- Explore publication routes for DH training materials (Carpentries Incubator, Programming Historian)

Is there anything else that you would like to tell us or feedback regarding your fellowship to date?
